Pull any changes from your team's project.
Make a branch.
Complete the work.
Lint and format the code.
Commit and push.
Make a pull request for your new branch.
Let your team know there is a pull request waiting.
Another team member should review the pull request in GitHub and, if everything looks good, Merge the request.
Delete the old branch.
Move the Trello card to the "Done" list.
